# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Clock and chronograph on 5x17 LED display"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Mode toggles between modes, power controls the brightness of the LED display, and start/stop control the display depending on the mode"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Try reseting the design, changing modes, setting the clock, start, stop, and reset the chronograph"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
